# HMAC Authentication in Spring Boot

This project demonstrates how to implement **HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)** authentication for API requests in a Spring Boot application. The frontend calculates the HMAC for each request and the backend verifies it, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of sensitive API endpoints.

## Features

- **HMAC Authentication**: Secure HMAC generation and verification for API calls.
- **Spring Boot Setup**: Easy-to-setup Spring Boot application with minimal dependencies.
- **Secure API Endpoints**: Protect sensitive API endpoints using HMAC.
- **Base64-encoded HMAC**: HMACs are Base64-encoded for easier transmission.
- **Protected Resources**: A protected endpoint that requires HMAC authentication for access.
## Tech Stack

- **Spring Boot** (3.x)
- **Java** (17+)
- **HMAC-SHA256** for hashing
- **Base64** for encoding HMACs
- **Maven** for project management and build

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run this project locally, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Java 17 or higher**: Ensure you have Java 17+ installed on your machine.
- **Maven**: To build and run the project.

You can download Java 17+ from [here](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) and Maven from [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hmac-spring-boot-demo.git
cd hmac-spring-boot-demo
```

### Build the Project

Use Maven to build the project:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Run the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

By default, the Spring Boot application will be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Endpoints

### 1. **GET /hmac/generate**

This endpoint generates the HMAC for a given request body using the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm and a shared secret key.

#### Request:

- **URL**: `http://localhost:8080/hmac/generate`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Body** (raw text or JSON):
  - Example Body:
    ```json
    "Data to be authenticated"
    ```

#### Response:

The response will return the **Base64 encoded HMAC**:

```json
"XyZ6pRslWf5yR6ld8k0Nm68JwRPkmJlMjQemxqIEHXg="
```

If the HMAC generation fails, an error message will be returned:

```json
{
  "error": "Error generating HMAC: <error_message>"
}
```

### 2. **GET /hmac/generate**

This endpoint generates the HMAC for a given request body using the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm and a shared secret key.

#### Request:

- **URL**: `http://localhost:8080/hmac/protected-resource`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Body** (raw text or JSON):
  - Example Body:
    ```json
    "Data to be authenticated"
    ```
- **Header**:    X-HMAC:NTzGucN2Bp0e1jPrFgTT4sK6/LhR7o9c2FwhvvquK1U=

#### Response:

The response will return the **OK 200**:

```
"This is a protected resource!"
```

If the authentication fails, an error message will be returned with **Unauthorized/Invalid HMAC 400**::



## Testing the API

### Using Postman:

1. **Create a New Request** in Postman.
2. **Method**: `POST`
3. **URL**: `http://localhost:8080/hmac/generate`
4. **Body**: Select **raw** and **Text** in Postman, and input the text data you want to authenticate (e.g., `"Data to be authenticated"`).
5. **Send the Request** and check the response. The HMAC will be returned as a **Base64 encoded string**.

### Using cURL:

You can also use `cURL` to test the API:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/hmac/generate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "\"Data to be authenticated\""
```

This will return the **Base64-encoded HMAC** in the response.

### Sample Response:

```json
"XyZ6pRslWf5yR6ld8k0Nm68JwRPkmJlMjQemxqIEHXg="
```

## Security Considerations

- **Secret Key**: The secret key used to generate the HMAC must be **securely stored**. Never expose the secret key in the client-side code (e.g., JavaScript or mobile apps). Use secure vaults or environment variables to manage secrets.
  
- **Data Integrity**: Since HMACs are calculated based on the request data, any changes in the data will result in a different HMAC. This ensures that the request has not been tampered with during transmission.

- **Token Expiry and Rotation**: Rotate secret keys periodically to minimize the impact of potential leaks or security vulnerabilities.

- **Use HMAC for Sensitive Operations Only**: HMAC should be used for sensitive endpoints (e.g., `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` operations). For non-sensitive operations like `GET` requests (e.g., fetching public data), HMAC is not necessary.

- **Rate Limiting**: Consider applying **rate-limiting** to your APIs to prevent abuse, especially for endpoints that require HMAC generation.


---

### Notes:

- This project assumes that both the frontend and backend share a **secret key** for generating and validating the HMAC.
- HMAC is only used for requests that modify data (e.g., creating, updating, or deleting resources). Use other forms of authentication, such as **API Keys** or **JWT** tokens, for less sensitive data or public endpoints.
- **Front-end implementation**: For real-world use, the front-end would calculate the HMAC using the same secret key and pass it along in the request header, which the backend will verify.
